			<h1>Formal Research Project</h1>
			<p>The formal research project was the next project up on the list for students to complete. This would have to be the most extensive project that the students were required to complete. The topic that they had to research was about their majors again. Only this time they had to investigate the reading and writing requirements that are seen in their prospective majors and find out what research goes on in their majors. For this project, it needed students to interview a professor who teaches in the field and a person who works in a field their major encompasses. The students also had to read articles to help fill in the information they were missing and incorporate those into their paper. This project requires a great deal of effort for students and the word count reflects this. The paper had to be between 2,700-3,000 words. That is a lot of words and students should not wait until the last minute to begin this project. There is simply too much work to be done to wait. Students should try to set up their interviews earlier rather then later because all the other WRA courses are working on their research projects at the same time and the professors get tired of answering the same questions over and over. Students should also look at interviewing TA’s because not very many people think to ask them and they are usually excited when someone asks to interview them. Since there is so much the student must do for this project, there are a couple of writing activities along the way to help students move along. At the beginning of the project, students had to complete an activity called the library activity. This helped students get used to Michigan State’s database system and assisted them in learning how to make good searched to yield the information they wanted. The next activity was a drafting activity where the students wrote an executive summary on their topic, which helped the students start thinking about what ideas they want to incorporate into their papers and how they want to incorporate them. Once these were turned in, the professor had the students peer edit and write an outline for their papers so they could further organize their thoughts. Once all of this occurred, students were off to writing their papers. This project has too much information to wait until the last minute, so it cannot be stressed enough that students give themselves enough time to write their papers because it will not turn out well if they wait.</p>
