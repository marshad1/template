			<h1>The Quality of Life of a Chemical Engineer</h1>
			<p>Being a chemical engineer, there is a lot at stake. Having the title comes with a lot of responsibility to society. Society expects them to answer their questions and solve their problems while they turn their attention to other pressing matters. It is up to the engineers to help make life better for everyone else. Since so much is expected, the jobs and projects chemical engineers undertake can be stressful. The engineers have to make sure they stay on task with their projects and make their deadlines and stay within budget. When they finish up their projects and it comes report time, chemical engineers have to remember everything that occurred during the project and write it down and make sure they are detailed and accurate. They have to make sure all the steps and procedures and results are there in the report so when other people go to read it and analyze it and undertake the project themselves, they can achieve the same results. This may sound tedious and time consuming being so thorough, but society compensates chemical engineers well. Chemical engineers across the board have one of the highest starting salaries out of any discipline. The table below compares the starting salaries between chemical engineers and chemists in 2008.<img src="Table 1.png" width="600px" height="200px"></p><br />
Just having a B.A in chemical engineering earns more money for recent graduates with full-time employment then a chemist with an M.S in chemistry. The line graphs below shows the salary earnings between chemists and chemical engineers between 1975 and 2008.<br /><br /> <p><img src="Graph 1.png" width="600px" height="400px"></p><br /><br /><p><img src="Graph 2.png" width="600px" height="400px"></p><br /> As the graphs show, chemical engineers have consistently had a higher starting salary then chemists. Chemical engineers have a high salary in general when compared to their chemist counterparts. The table below shows the median salaries for chemists and chemical engineers and compares them based on degree, employer, and age for 2012. As the table shows, chemical engineers make much more money then chemists in every category.<br /><br /><p><img src="Table 2.jpeg" width="500px" height="500px"></p> The good news for people that want to get a degree and work in this field is that there is a high demand for chemical engineers. There are more jobs out there right now for chemical engineers then there are chemical engineers to fill those positions. Most people that graduate these days take awhile before they can land a job. With a chemical engineering degree, people have no trouble at all finding a job. A lot of the times these people get multiple job offers since companies really want to hire chemical engineers. Even though society puts a lot of burden onto chemical engineers, they are compensated well for their stress with a high salary and a high demand in the job market for chemical engineers. Chemical engineers have a nice quality of life with the high salary and high demand for workers.</p>
