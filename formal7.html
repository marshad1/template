			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Chemical engineering has a huge impact on society. The engineers in this discipline have created everything from household cleaners, to lifesaving medicines, to food additives to help keep food fresher longer. Chemical engineering is one of the widest and most encompassing of the engineering disciplines and the people that work in this field have a wide range of areas that they can choose to work in. The areas can be from developing new chemicals and medicines to taking the creation of others and helping mass-produce those creations in an economical fashion. Communication is a key part to success in chemical engineering. This communication comes in the form of writing, which ranges from memos, texts, and emails to reports on entire projects. Besides writing, chemical engineers must also read up on the latest that is happening in the field and read what projects are just finishing up and keeping tabs on competitive companies. A lot is asked of chemical engineers, but society compensates them well for their work. Jim lives a happy life as a chemical engineer, so get excited to be creative and to help lift society to a time of unprecedented prosperity.  </p>
