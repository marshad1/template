<p><b>Composing in Context:</b> The issue that our group chose to do for the project strongly influenced the way we composed our project. Our group decided to write about Mitch’s ACL tear, so after that decision was made, we went about deciding what elements of this experience we wanted to include in our documentary and what type of message we wanted to communicate to the audience. Composing the documentary about Mitch’s ACL tear helped me to better understand what a person like that goes through when they tear an ACL. Beforehand, I had seen a good handful of ACL tears and those people never seemed to make a big deal about that so whenever I would see one I would think to myself, oh its just an ACL tear. Listening to Mitch talk about it I realize the internal struggle people deal with when they have an injury like that I was able to better realize how serious of an injury tearing an ACL is. It was interesting talking with Mitch and learning how his perspective on life changed after he tore his ACL. Problems that we encountered when we were organizing and composing the documentary were in deciding what information we wanted to put in the documentary and in what sequence we wanted that information to come. Also we had to decide what message we wanted to communicate to our audience and what themes we wanted present in the documentary.  There was a lot of information at our disposal and it was difficult trying to choose what information to put in and what information to leave out. The audience played an important role in the way we organized our documentary because we had to consider that besides the class being an audience the professor was a big audience and we needed to compose our documentary so that she could see we had met all the requirements she was looking for.</p><br /> 

<p><b>Process:</b> The way our group selected our topic was we talked about all the different papers each of us had and narrowed them down to one paper. We decided to use Mitch’s paper on his ACL tear because we felt like there was a plethora of information at our disposal we would be able to convey an important message to the audience that would be worth their time hearing. The most challenging part of the project was trying to get an interview with a doctor. We tried multiple times to get in contact with a doctor that does ACL surgery, but they never followed up with us and another issue was that there were no good ACL surgery videos on YouTube that we could use in our documentary. Our group did take a systematic approach. We planned everything out and set deadlines and were able to complete a well thought-out project in a timely manner.</p><br /> 

<p><b>Research:</b> Mitch was our most beneficial research resource sine he had experienced this type of injury and he was able to provide most of the information on any questions we had. He also was able to supply many pictures of the injury for us to use in the documentary. The least beneficial research resource was the doctor because we were never able to get in touch with a doctor.</p><br />

<p><b>Collaboration:</b> Jenna, Mitch, and I all worked well together. We were able to help each other out on anything that we needed, we completed everything when we said we would, and were able to have plenty of time to compose the documentary and complete the project with time to spare. Working in groups was fruitful because it was nice to work with other people and to bounce ideas off of each other and to be able to lean on each other for support.</p><br />

<p><b>Project Management:</b> I would say our group did a good job at planning the work for this project. We were able to complete everything when we said we would and we gave ourselves plenty of time to work on the project and be able to complete it in a timely fashion. It helped that we planned out the project and who was going to do what before we started working on it so there was no confusion on what people were supposed to do and everyone had a job to do. If there was more time to work on the project, I feel that each of us would have been more involved in what the other was doing because it was hard having break while working on the project because it does make it hard to get together with everyone to work on it while everyone is home.</p><br /> 

<p><b>Documentary Design:</b> The most effective aspect of the documentary is having someone who has experienced this type of injury talking because it gives our documentary a credible source. I think a nice part of design was that it looks like a documentary with the different segments spliced together seamlessly to help create a nice documentary feel. We made our design decisions based on the information that was available to us and what information we did and did not want to include in our documentary.</p><br />
