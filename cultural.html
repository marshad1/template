			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>The cultural artifact that will be analyzed is the television show, The Big Bang Theory. The show surrounds the life of four California Institute of Technology researchers by the names of Sheldon, Leonard, Howard, and Raj. These four scientists embody the stereotypical nerd where they have collections of comic books, can be socially awkward, and go to renaissance fairs. Being the nerds that they are, they were and still are to some extent bullied. Bullying is a big social issue right now and people are becoming more active in trying to minimize its effects. The show has many references to bullying that the characters endured during their childhood and for some of the episodes they show some of the characters being bullied as adults. When they have these episodes, they show how the characters react to the different situations that they are exposed to. The position on bullying is that it is harmful to the victim and should not be tolerated in society. People should be celebrated and encouraged for their individuality instead of being bullied and forced to mask their individuality so that they do not get bullied. Sheldon, Leonard, Howard, and Raj were all beat up as kids for being the smart ones in their hometowns and having different interests then most of the other kids they grew up with. The solution to bullying should be to create more tolerance among people by educating them on different cultures and socioeconomic classes so that people are no longer ignorant. Ignorance is a big issue for why people bully other individuals. It is much easier to lash out at someone when you do not understanding instead of trying to hear their side of the story and learn and understand where they are coming from. The way that society could overcome this ignorance is to create ways to teach people tolerance and acceptance. One way that this could be achieved is to create shows that embody these principles. This would show people a positive way to react if they ever encounter a real life situation, and it would teach people the backgrounds of all walks of life so that the ignorance factor can be removed and bullying can be minimalized.</p>
