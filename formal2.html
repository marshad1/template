			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Engineering plays a critical part in the development of society. Everything manmade that one can see around them was designed by an engineer. From the paper that is made, to computers, to stairs, to medicine, they all had to be created by an engineer at some point.  Chemical engineering is one of the broadest engineering disciplines that someone could have a degree in. Engineering has three major areas of academia that it draws on. These areas are math, physics, and chemistry. Many of the engineering disciplines only majorly incorporate two out of those three areas. As the name implies, while drawing on math and physics, chemical engineering also draws on chemistry. What makes chemical engineering so broad and encompassing is the fact that it draws on all three areas of engineering. This allows for a wide range of activities to occur and much flexibility in what one wants to do. The two main activities that happen in chemical engineering are chemical processing and manufacturing. These two branches contain countless ways to help contribute to society. In chemical processing, engineers try to create new chemicals and medicines that have some sort of benefit to people. The engineers in manufacturing take the chemicals that were created by the engineers in chemical processing and mass-produce them so that many people will be able to have access to what was created. To be successful in chemical engineering, and engineering in general, people will work in teams to help solve the problems they are faced with. Two heads are better then one when it comes to some of the problems that engineers have to solve. Communication is crucial to successfully solving the problems at hand. Much of the communication that chemical engineers encounter is through writing. There is a wide range of writing that people in this field work with. It is from basic forms of writing like emails and texts back and forth between team members to complex forms in the shape of reports. Reports are where the chemical engineers in the project write up all what they did, how they did it, and what their results were. The reports are the major way chemical engineers communicate their knowledge and findings across the whole discipline. Chemical engineers also have to do a fair amount of reading. The reading ranges from reading up on what their team members are working on to reading up on the latest things that are happening in the discipline. The technology that is available these days helps with fast and efficient communication. It also allows for a wider range of research to be done. With the new technology that is being invented, more questions can be answered that previously could not be answered since the technology was not there to carry out the proper research and experiments to answer those questions. Technology is critical to the research and progression of the field because without modern day technology much of the research would not be able to occur. Chemical engineering is an exciting field buzzing with questions waiting to be answered and secrets to be unveiled. </p>
