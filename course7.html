			<h1>Miscellaneous Information</h1>
			<p>Besides the five projects the students had to do during their tenure in WRA 110, there was also some extra stuff they had to complete. First of all, students should go to class every time it meets. This section of WRA 110 only meets once a week, so if students can go to class they should go to class. There are in class activities the professor randomly has the students do and if they are not there on the day its comes up, they will not get credit for that assignment. Also to teach students HTML and CSS so they would be able to work on their websites they needed to complete the HTML and CSS lessons on codecademy. This is worth a big portion of in class work so students should steadily work on it during the semester. The website the students had to create where they put all their projects on is their online portfolio. Each assignment that the students did, they also had to upload a copy of their project to their portfolio. In addition to that, the students had to write fifteen blog entries that reflected on the course at different times. These blogs are useful in helping the student write their Course Retrospective so students should write their blog entries consistently during the semester instead of waiting until the end because they will have better information to use if they write their blogs throughout the semester. Students by the end of the semester have to redesign their website. At the beginning of the semester, the professor gives students a website template to work off of, but by the end of the semester students should know enough about HTML and CSS to redesign their website so it does not look like the template. Students will lose points if their portfolio looks like the template the professor gave at the beginning of the semester. Students learn a lot in WRA 110 and it is a course that students should get excited about because they will learn skills beyond writing that will help them later in life.</p>
