The Big Bang Theory does a good job at bring up the issue of bullying and showing their audience different situations and showing their viewers how to deal with these situation should they find themselves in a similar situation in real life. The solution to bullying is to create more shows like The Big Bang Theory to show viewers different walks of life so that people are more tolerant and accepting of different people so that they are less likely to bully. It has already been shown that this solution works with different social issues and creating more of these kinds of shows would make a big impact on issues like bullying and would help create a more tolerant and accepting society.</p>
