        	<p>I am a freshman at Michigan State University. I am also a Spartan swimmer. I have been swimming for most of my life and am quite accomplished at it. In high school I was swimmer of the year, two time state champ in the 100 back. I hold 16 records at my home pool and countless others at different pools around the state. I have competed on the national level and have been able to travel to some pretty cool places because of swimming. Choosing to become a Spartan was one of the best decisions of my life and I can't wait to see what the next four years have in store for me! </p>
