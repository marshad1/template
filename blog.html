			<p>The purpose of the video was for the author to express his anger to his 
			for committing suicide and to send a meesage out to people that things do get 
			better and you are great the way you are and never let things get you so down 
			that you contemplate suicide because things do get better. The video did a good
			job at achieving this purpose. The author shared some very personal experiences
			with the audience and successfully got across his message using his personal experiences. 
			The author's message was towards the end because he wanted to share his experiences 
			with the audience to get them hooked into the story so that they woud listed to
		    what he has to say. It was effective because as the audience, I wanted to listen 
		    more to his story and to hear what he had to say and to hear what message he wanted 
		    to get across to the audience. This will help us with our lived experience project 
		    because it allowed us to see a good example of a narrative and to see how he structured
		    his narrative. We now have a base that we can refer to when we are doing our final
		    edits on our papers and we have an example that allows us to see what we liked 
		    and what we did not like about his structure and let us have a better sense of 
		    how we want to structure our final drafts. </p>

		    <p>	The role of women in the tech industry is an interesting thing to think about. In the film The Social Network we are able to see the role that women play. Within the industry, I feel that women take on a secondary role to men and there is more inequality here then there is in other industries. At the beginning of the movie, Zuckerburg creates a website (which is the prototype of Facebook) called facesmash.  What happens on this site is that people can go there and two women are put up on the screen to be compared by the reader to see which one is hotter and then they click on the woman’s picture of who they think is hotter to continue. This shows how women are seen as objects and not equals to their male counterparts since they are being objectified in this manner. In the movie, you do not see that many women within the Facebook company and all you see are mostly men working on the coding for the website. All throughout the movie, women are seen as a step-down from their male counterparts. For example, when Mark’s girlfriend breaks up with him he goes on a blogging spree saying some nasty things about her and not very many people tell him to stop or do anything. They just laugh it off. The movie seems to capture the role of women in the tech industry where it is still like the old-school thought of that men are superior to women and they should do all the work compared to the new school movement now in other industries where women are treated as equals and respected as such. The Social Network does a good job at describing the role of women in the tech industry where they are still not seen as equals yet compared to other industries.</p>
