			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>There is a solution to bullying that, if implemented, would be successful. The solution would be to give people access to the knowledge of different cultures and socioeconomic classes and show people all the walks of life so that they would become more tolerant and be less likely to bully. To give people access to this knowledge, television shows could be created to give people the opportunity to see these different kinds of people and situations so that if they ever find themselves in that kind of situation they would know how to react. An example of implementing this solution is another episode of The Big Bang Theory. In season five, this episode showcases an evening involving Penny, Bernadette, and Amy. While they are getting ready to go out for the night, they are reflecting on their high school days. Bernadette and Amy talk about how they were bullied and share some of the stories about what happened. Penny, on the other hand, shares a story that disturbs Bernadette and Amy. Penny tells the story about how her and her friends tied up one of their classmates and then stuck them in a cornfield and then abandoned them. Penny sees this situation as that her and her friends were having fun whereas Bernadette and Amy see that as bullying. Once Penny realizes that she did in fact bully people in high school she wants to repent for her actions and apologize to her victims (“The Speckerman Recurrence”). In this situation, it shows the audience that people do not always realize. Sometimes they think they are joking around as how Penny saw the situation. Bernadette and Amy point out to Penny that what she did was bullying and not for fun. This shows that if one sees bullying occurring, they should say something to the bully because they may not realize what they are doing as shown by Penny, Bernadette, and Amy. </p>
