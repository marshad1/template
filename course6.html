			<h1>Course Retrospective Project</h1>
			<p>The final project that the students had to complete was the Course Retrospective. This project had students reflect on the course and have them write in a way to give them advice to people that would be taking this course in the future. Besides doing this, the class had to create a website with helpful hints and tips to succeeding in WRA 110. The amount of work needed to complete this project is comparable to the Lived Experiences project with there being about the same word length of 1,500-2,000 words. This is a nice project to wrap up the semester with because it gives students the opportunity to look back on their work and apply everything they have learned during that semester. The professor had students create a rough draft so they could get their thoughts organized and not wait until the last minute to write the paper because no one wants to write and turn in a first draft paper and not get the grade they were hoping for because they did not put a lot of effort into the last paper. Writing the Course Retrospective is not that bad and students should give themselves plenty of time to write it so they can go out of the course with a bang instead of a bust.</p>
