			<h1>The Reading and Writing that Chemical Engineers Do</h1>
			<p>Writing is key to effective communication in chemical engineering. Much of the time chemical engineers are having to do some sort of writing while on the job. The amount of writing that has to be done depends on the job that one is working on. Some jobs require that most of their work be some sort of writing while other jobs have the engineers hardly write at all. Most of the writing that chemical engineers do is communicating between the team members that are on their project. This writing takes the form of emails and memos and texts. The writing that is in emails and memos and texts is mostly check-ins and weekly updates  and letting everyone who is working on the project know how it is progressing and letting them know what work has been done and what still has to be done (Hinds). The major writing that chemical engineers have to do are reports. The reports that chemical engineers create describe the project that they worked on from start to finish. This answers the questions of what they did, how did they do it, and what did they find. This piece of writing is usually extensive since there is a lot of knowledge that needs to be communicated. Reports are the major way that chemical engineers communicate across the entire discipline because the reports get published and any chemical engineer that wants to read about what happened is able to. Writing is a crucial part of being a chemical engineer since it is the main way knowledge is communicated across the discipline and the main way chemical engineers communicate with one another.</p> 
	<p>Besides all the writing that chemical engineers do, they also have to do a fair amount of reading. Much of the reading that people have to do is keeping up with what is going on in the discipline. A great way to keep up with the latest is to read magazines and publications.  In these, you can read about the latest technology that is available and the research that is going on. One can also read about experiments that just finished up or research that concluded and see what successes and failures that people had (Hinds). Besides just keeping up with the field, many people will read the patent journal. The patent journal allows people to see what others are working on and is a good way to see what the competition is working on. The reading chemical engineers have to do is not bad. They just need to keep up with the latest in the field and keep up with what their competition is working on.
