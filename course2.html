			<h1>Lived Experiences Project</h1>
			<p>The first project that students will encounter is the Lived Experiences project. This project has students writing a personal narrative on a piece of technology of their choice and how it helped them decide on what major to pursue. This is a nice project to get the semester rolling with because it has the students relying on previous knowledge and does not require them to do any research. The word count is not bad with the paper needing to be at least 1,200 words long. The professor gives students ample time to work on the paper and gives them much help along the way. There is a drafting activity that the professor creates, which helps the students start thinking about their papers and gives them a general idea of what the professor is looking for. The professor also will read over the studentâ€™s papers if asked and give them feedback so that they can do well on the paper. At the beginning of the semester also, the professor reviews with students about what principles to keep in mind while writing their papers and also teaches them the basics of how they will need go about fulfilling their website component. All in all, students should not have any difficulty with this paper because there is plenty of time to write is and there is much help available to students.</p>
