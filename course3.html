			<h1>Cultural Analysis Project</h1>
			<p>The next project the students had to complete was the Cultural Analysis paper. This required students to analyze a cultural artifact of their choice, choose a social issue surrounding that cultural artifact, and propose a solution to that social issue in relation to the cultural artifact. This project is more in-depth then the Lived Experiences project and will take students more time to complete. Since more work needs to be done for this project, the word length for the paper is 1,800-2,100 words. It may sound like a lot, but once the students do their research on their cultural artifact and compile all their information together it is really not that bad. Students will have to do some outside research to help them fulfill the requirements of the assignment. The nice part about the assignment is that the cultural artifact can be just about anything. This ranges from a TV show to a movie, to basically anything they could think of with the professorâ€™s approval. This does make the project easier because students can pick an artifact they are experts in, which will make the paper easier to write. The professor provides the students with another drafting activity, which helps give them an idea of what the professor is looking for. An important part of this project is students will peer edit other students writing to help give them feedback. Peer editing is an important skill for students to hone because it helps give them an opportunity to see what and how their peers are writing and gives students ideas to help benefit their writing. Also with this project, in their web component, students have to create multiple pages in their website, which the professor shows the students how to do. This paper requires more effort on the students end to do well, so they should give themselves plenty of time to write it and not wait until the last minute to do it because it will make for a long night.</p>
