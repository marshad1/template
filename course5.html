			<h1>Multimedia Remix</h1>
			<p>After working hard on their research projects, the next task the students were faced with was the Multimedia Remix project. This project gives students a little break from writing and exposes them to new forms of media. The premise behind this project was students got to work in groups, and within their groups they had to choose one of their previous papers and create a documentary on that paper. This project is nice for students because they get to focus on something other then writing and they also get practice in new forms of media. The drafting activity the professor had the students do was to create a proposal for their documentary, carefully planning out everything they wanted to accomplish. The piece of writing that goes along with this project is a memo discussing how the project went and how well their group members worked together. This was an easy piece of writing because it was only required to be one to two pages in length.  All in all, this was a fun project for students to work on because it allowed them to be in groups and to investigate and analyze new forms of media and create their own piece of new media. </p>
