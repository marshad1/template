			<h1>Technology: Creating Opportunities at Every Turn</h1>
			<p>Technology is a critical part of chemical engineering. Technology is so important that much of the research and work that is being done could not be done without the technology that is available today. Chemical engineers are always trying to create new technology and improve old technology to help with their research and to try to progress the field. An example of technology helping research in chemical engineering is in the branch of chemical processing and sorting particles. Sometimes, especially with biological and chemical systems, engineers need to sort out particles that are suspended in a highly viscous fluid and that becomes difficult when the particle and the fluid have very similar densities. This problem arises in gel particle separation from polymers. The engineers cannot use techniques such as, “classical sieving methods [because they] are practically prohibited due to the strong interaction. Sedimentation is not applicable when the particles and the fluid have almost same densities and the settling velocities are low.” (Malktua 1). What engineers have done to solve this problem is to sort the particle out through laminar tube flows, which is a tube where the engineers run the particle through and it collects on the sides of the tube while the fluid passes through. Technology is helping research to be done that would have never been able to happen if that technology was not there. It is also helping improve communication and collaboration. Communication is increasingly becoming electronic since the development and boom of smartphones. The technology is allowing chemical engineers to communicate among each other much faster then it used to through the use of texts and emails and the Internet. This allows projects to be completed faster and more efficient since there is not as much time lost waiting for a response from someone. It is also helping more information to be accessible to more people. With the Internet, more people have access to reports of projects that chemical engineers publish and more people are able to look at that problem and be able to help solve the problem. Technology is also helping chemical engineers be more connected with one another. With the invention of smartphones and the booming of video chatting, chemical engineers from around the world are able to work with each other on projects and help solve more problems. This is useful because instead of having to have everyone working on the project be in the same location, they can be spread out and still achieve success. It is a lot easier to video chat and email and text someone instead of having to move them half way across the world to work on a project. Technology does countless things for chemical engineering. It helps make communication swifter and efficient and it allows for research to be done that could not have been done beforehand. Technology makes a huge impact and will continue to be a critical aspect of chemical engineering. </p>
