			<h1>The Life of a Chemical Engineer</h1>
			<p>Buzz, buzz, buzzâ€¦ The alarm clock begins to vibrate and blare obnoxiously throughout the room. Jim rolls over and satisfactorily hits the snooze button, knowing full well that he can afford the extra time for a few more minutes of shuteye. The process repeats itself just a mere nine minutes later. This time, though, Jim turns the alarm up and sits up for the first time rubbing the sleep out of his eyes and getting ready to start the day. He jumps in the shower before sitting down to have a bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee while perusing the newspaper. After he finishes his cereal and his cup of jo, he gets into his car and speeds away to work. Once Jim arrives, he is greeted by many of his coworkers and they quietly chat amongst themselves as they get ready to get to work as chemical engineers.</p>
