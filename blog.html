			<h1>Blog Entry #1</h1>
			<p>The purpose of the video was for the author to express his anger to his 
			for committing suicide and to send a meesage out to people that things do get 
			better and you are great the way you are and never let things get you so down 
			that you contemplate suicide because things do get better. The video did a good
			job at achieving this purpose. The author shared some very personal experiences
			with the audience and successfully got across his message using his personal experiences. 
			The author's message was towards the end because he wanted to share his experiences 
			with the audience to get them hooked into the story so that they woud listed to
		    what he has to say. It was effective because as the audience, I wanted to listen 
		    more to his story and to hear what he had to say and to hear what message he wanted 
		    to get across to the audience. This will help us with our lived experience project 
		    because it allowed us to see a good example of a narrative and to see how he structured
		    his narrative. We now have a base that we can refer to when we are doing our final
		    edits on our papers and we have an example that allows us to see what we liked 
		    and what we did not like about his structure and let us have a better sense of 
		    how we want to structure our final drafts. </p>
