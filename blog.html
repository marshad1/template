			<p>The purpose of the video was for the author to express his anger to his for committing suicide and to send a message out to people that things do get better and you are great the way you are and never let things get you so down that you contemplate suicide because things do get better. The video did a good job at achieving this purpose. The author shared some very personal experiences with the audience and successfully got across his message using his personal experiences. The author's message was towards the end because he wanted to share his experiences with the audience to get them hooked into the story so that they would listen to what he has to say. It was effective because as the audience, I wanted to listen more to his story and to hear what he had to say and to hear what message he wanted to get across to the audience. This will help us with our lived experience project because it allowed us to see a good example of a narrative and to see how he structured his narrative. We now have a base that we can refer to when we are doing our final edits on our papers and we have an example that allows us to see what we liked and what we did not like about his structure and let us have a better sense of how we want to structure our final drafts.</p>

		    <p>For the lived experience project, it was not too difficult to find a piece of technology that helped me to choose my major. Not finding this task hard was a nice change of pace for me because it usually takes me longer to think about what I am going to use to write about. This was a nice assignment to start off the year with because it was on something we should have some knowledge on and it related to past experiences that we have had. It was nice for me because I came to Michigan State University with a declared major, which I think helped a lot give me clarity and direction with the assignment. I feel like it would have been harder if I were undeclared because then I would not have had as clear of a direction and I would not have known what to write about.</p>

		    <p>I liked the drafting activity that was given to us because it helped me start thinking about and planning on what I was going to write about. It also helped because it gave me a clearer idea of what the professor was looking for. It was nice having it be called a drafting activity instead of a rough draft because it takes some of the pressure off that I feel when writing a rough draft. When I have to write a rough draft, I feel as though I have to write my paper so that I can go back and edit it and change some things around before turning it in. Having it be called a drafting activity was like how my writing teacher my senior year would call rough drafts a zero draft, or first draft, etc. based on how far along we were in a project. </p>

		    <p>The role of women in the tech industry is an interesting thing to think about. In the film The Social Network we are able to see the role that women play. Within the industry, I feel that women take on a secondary role to men and there is more inequality here then there is in other industries. At the beginning of the movie, Zuckerburg creates a website (which is the prototype of Facebook) called facesmash.  What happens on this site is that people can go there and two women are put up on the screen to be compared by the reader to see which one is hotter and then they click on the woman’s picture of who they think is hotter to continue. This shows how women are seen as objects and not equals to their male counterparts since they are being objectified in this manner. In the movie, you do not see that many women within the Facebook company and all you see are mostly men working on the coding for the website. All throughout the movie, women are seen as a step-down from their male counterparts. For example, when Mark’s girlfriend breaks up with him he goes on a blogging spree saying some nasty things about her and not very many people tell him to stop or do anything. They just laugh it off. The movie seems to capture the role of women in the tech industry where it is still like the old-school thought of that men are superior to women and they should do all the work compared to the new school movement now in other industries where women are treated as equals and respected as such. The Social Network does a good job at describing the role of women in the tech industry where they are still not seen as equals yet compared to other industries.</p>

		    <p>Being able to write about a TV show for the cultural analysis project was a nice surprise. I thought it was going to have to be an actual artifact of something like what you would call something you find from ancient times. Before talking about the assignment in class, I thought we were going to have to write about a different culture and find an artifact to represent that culture and write about that. I enjoyed being able to write about a TV show and a social issue because it seemed much easier then the way I had thought we were going to have to write it.  After going over it in class, I decided right away that I wanted to write about the show “The Big Bang Theory” because that is my favorite show and I have extensive knowledge over the subject. The hard part will be thinking about what social issue to write about. That is going to take some time to think about…</p>
		    <h1>Blog Entry #6</h1>
		    <p>I figured out what my social issue is going to be for “The Big Bang Theory”. I am going to write about the social issue of bullying. I don’t know why I had not thought of that before since the issue is so prevalent in the show. It actually took me talking to my sister to realize the extensiveness of the issue of bullying is in the show. The writers do a good job at disguising it in the show so that people learn without actually realizing they are actually learning. Brilliant really.</p>

		    <p>The cultural analysis paper for me was harder to write then the lived experience project. I think it was because I had to do a little research in this paper whereas I didn’t have to in the other one.  Also, I was getting more work form all my other classes so I was still trying to adjust to everything.  It was also the point in time where we were starting to pick up our training intensity in swimming so I was more tired. Once the first draft was completed, it made it easier to continue on with the paper.  It made writing the final draft easier because I had already written out what I wanted to say. This was also a paper where I was struggling to try to find the right words to say in it. I had a general idea of what I wanted to say but to find the specific words and flow was difficult. I think this is a reason why I do not like writing a lot because I feel as though it is difficult for me to try to express what I want to get across in words. This was also a paper where I kept letting myself get a little too distracted while I was working on it. I think a reason for this was that I had less motivation to write it because I was having trouble finding the right words. All in all, I was happy with how the paper turned out because it was up to my standard for how I like to turn my papers in.</p>

		    <p>Ah the formal research paper here at last. The thing I have been dreading most about in this class. It’s not that I dislike the project, I haven’t even really begun to dive into it yet but it’s the fact I still feel scarred from my last research paper that I had to write last year. Whoa that one was a doozy. I was somewhat hoping that I would be able to reuse that research paper this year because I think up to date that has been the one piece of writing I have spent the most amount of time on and am the proudest of. Anyways writing a research paper sounds like a lot of work. It was nice to have the library activity to help introduce us to what we were going to have to do for this assignment. It was not nice in the sense that we were in Iowa for a swim meet and I found out from a fellow classmate that we had this activity to do and I had about an hour to complete it before it was due. I was able to crank it out though and get it turned in on time, which I was happy about. I always seem to find the most motivation for things when I am running against the clock.</p>

		    <p>Trying to write a draft for the formal research project was hard. I felt like I had little motivation to write a draft for it and actually get any work on it done. When writing the draft, I kept trying to circumvent actually committing to anything and writing about what I wanted to write about. For the outline, I just wrote about a plan for things I wanted to say in the paper. I feel like I have this problem a lot in writing where I just don’t want to commit to anything until I absolutely have to. I end up wasting a lot of time doing this, which are not the best time management skills for an athlete to have.  During this time, I also felt very distracted and let myself wander way too much. Once I did commit to a plan in writing, it helped a little bit to start writing the actual paper. It is always good to have a drafting activity for me because it helps me not procrastinate as much because I have checkpoints to complete along the way.</p>

		    <p>The research was easy yet hard in itself at the same time. I was writing about my major, chemical engineering and there is so much that you could research that it was hard to narrow down on things. It helped having my interviews with working professors because it helped give me a clearer idea of what research I needed to do and how I wanted to write my paper. Since chemical engineering is such a broad discipline, I researched the parts of the field that I was interested in which helped make the project more enjoyable. I enjoyed researching all the different things chemical engineers have to do because it allowed me to answer some questions I was still having and be able to know what to expect from my major as I progress through it.</p>
		    <h1>Blog Entry #11</h1>
		    <p>My plan for the formal research project was going to be to write one draft of it and call it good since I still had a bad taste in my mouth from my past research experiences. This was not a great plan since you should never just do a one and done on a paper if you want to do well on it. As I finally started to write the paper and continued working on it I was not happy with how it was turning out. It was not up to the quality I like to hold myself up to. When I decided to write another draft of my research paper I really let the ball drop on the draft I was currently working on. Instead of actually writing stuff, I would still have some writing, but when I was unsure of what to write next I would write down the ideas I would like to talk about at that portion of the paper. This made me a little happier because I didn’t have to commit to anything and I could get my ideas written down and decide what to do with them at another time.  This paper came due at a bad time for me because I had two exams earlier that week that I had to study for before I could even think about this project. It was somewhat a blessing in disguise because it helped me to keep my focus for the whole week while I studied and when I started working on my paper. It was great for me because when I went to work on this final draft I had the motivation and the focus to work on it for however long it was going to take. There were a few spots where I had to stop for a bit while I tried to find the right words, but other then that the worlds and the ideas flowed onto the paper nicely and in a pattern I was happy with. When I finally finished the paper, it was up to a quality I would feel comfortable turning in and it was nice to be done with the research project.</p>

		    <p>The "Imported from Detroit" commercial that aired during the super bowl a few years ago became a huge hit and became a thing Detroit was proud of for a while. The purpose of the ad was to get people excited about Detroit again because it had been in decline for sometime and when the recession hit, it hit Detroit hard with the bankruptcy of the Big Three. Detroit had been known as a ghetto place for sometime and the people that represent Detroit want to try to change that image. They want to bring Detroit back to its former glory where people were proud to say they were from Detroit. The imagery that they showed of Detroit was the auto factories and the steel mills and the great culture that Detroit is known for. They also showed the pristine skyline that Detroit has. The imagery here was to remind people of all the great thing Detroit has to offer. The tagline of "Imported from Detroit" really stuck with people after the commercial. The tagline was supposed to make people feel like they are getting something special when they get something from Detroit. The authors tried to have Detroit be synonymous with something imported from say Italy. The voiceover was also important because they had someone with a rugged voice talk during the commercial. The point of it was to show that Detroit does have some ruggedness to it and that they have been around the block. The purpose of the ad has been achieved. The authors of the ad wanted the audience to recognize that they recognize that Detroit is still a rugged place sometime (the voiceover), but that Detroit is on the rise and that it is special to own something made in Detroit. The ad was successful in its purpose to make people excited about Detroit because people talked about the ad and the tagline for a long time after it was aired. The ad certainly got people talking about Detroit and in a positive light at that.</p>

		    <p>I was glad to hear that the remix project was a group project. I was getting tired of having to write long papers like the research project. The research project was a long project that required many words. It is a nice transition to have the next project be a documentary on one of the other projects. In my group I have Jenna and Mitch, which seems to be a good group to work in. We are going to make a documentary on when Mitch tore his ACL, which I think will turn out well. There is so much that we can do with this project it is nice to have the freedom to go as we please.  I like how the only writing we have to do for this project is to write a one to two page memo about our documentary and what direction we as a group decided to take. It does not seem like it will be that hard to write. </p>

		    <p>Our group met today to work on our documentary. What we discussed is the details about what we are going to include in our documentary and how we were going to go about doing that. It was a productive meeting because we figured out what everyone was going to do and how it was going to get done. After this meeting, I feel confident that our documentary is going to turn out well and I am excited to continue working on it. It helped that our first assignment for the remix project was to answer questions about who was going to be in the documentary and what our theme was going to be and other important questions because this got us thinking about what we were going to do for the documentary and gave our group a base for our detailed discussion on our documentary. </p>

		    <p>One thing I have enjoyed about this class is having to learn HTML and CSS. It was nice to have the web component where we had to put all of our papers on a website. It was good practice for us to apply the coding that we had to learn. I think this will serve me well in the future because I have this computer experience that I can take with me and use it in different parts of my life. When I have to do coding stuff for my engineering classes, I will now have familiarity of coding even if it isn’t HTML or CSS stuff. I am happy getting the opportunity to learn this because I will definitely want to make use of it in the future.</p>
