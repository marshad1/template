			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>Showing the audience situations like this can give them important information about what they should do should they find themselves in a similar situation. It shows the audience that they should stand up to a bully and try to prevent what is occurring because the bully may not realize what they are doing. Giving people knowledge like this and showing them different walks of life will help them to recognize a bullying situation when they see one and to take action to prevent the bullying or to let the bully know that their actions are harming the victim. The result would be that people would be more tolerant of others and be able to recognize bullying situations when they see it and know what to do if they find themselves being the victim or be the third party that stands up to the bully and have the bully realize what they are doing and have them stop. Some of this solution is already being implemented. For example, many television shows are now featuring main characters that are gay. Shows like Modern Family have been doing this for the past few years. These shows have gained large followings and people are able to watch these shows and see some of the other walks of life. As a result of this going on the past few years, people have become much more tolerant of gay people then they were just a few years ago when these shows were just starting out. This shows that creating television shows that showcase these different walks of life help people to be more tolerant and in turn bring the bullying down to a minimum. The solution is to create more shows that enshrine different walks of life because the results would be a more tolerant and accepting society because they would no longer be ignorant and would be less likely to bully others since they would now have the knowledge about these different walks of life.</p>
