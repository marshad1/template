			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Bullying is a serious social issue that can be seen in many different forms in culture. The Big Bang Theory does a good job at bringing up this issue and showing the audience different ways that they can deal with bullying. Bullying does nothing useful for people and only does damage. The main cause to bullying is ignorance among people. People will bully other people because it is the easy solution for them. It is a lot harder to learn about another culture or lifestyle and to try to understand their way of life and to see it though the other personâ€™s eyes. Individuals lash out at other people and bully them because they do not understand their way of life. Most people just take the easy way out and choose to be ignorant and bully because it is the way they have been taught and it is easier then trying to learn something new.</p>
