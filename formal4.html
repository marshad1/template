			<h1>Research Opportunities</h1>
			<p>Research is what drives chemical engineering. It is the questions that people want to answer is what keeps the field alive and growing. It is one of the reasons why there are so many job opportunities for chemical engineers. There are just so many questions that people want to know the answers to. There are two main branches of research that chemical engineers have to choose from. These two branches are chemical processing and manufacturing. The engineers in chemical processing are focused on developing new chemicals, which range from medicines, to food additives, to cleaning products, to industrial needs. The goal here is to discover new chemicals and processes and figure out a way to harness this knowledge to the benefit of society. An example of this type of research is the research being done by the associate professor of chemical engineering at Purdue University, You-Weon Won. The research that him and his team are undertaking is trying to make gene therapy safer and more effective. He states that the goal of this project is to develop a better method for gene therapy because right now, “a method for safe and efficient in vivo gene delivery into targeted cells is presently a major limiting factor” (Won 1). Him and his team are trying to improve current techniques to make gene therapy safer and more efficient by the creation of new nanotechnology to help aid in the treatments of diseases such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and Huntington’s disease. This is beneficial research because having more successful gene therapy will help people with these life-threatening diseases live a better quality of life and be able to live longer more fruitful lives. The range of chemicals that could be created is far reaching. The creation of chemicals for food are beneficial because it can allow society to store food for longer in a healthier way and creating new chemicals for industry will help cut costs and help optimize manufacturing. The other branch of research in chemical engineering is manufacturing. In manufacturing, the engineers take what the engineers created in the chemical processing branch and develop processes to help mass produce the chemicals that were created. Manufacturing and chemical processing have equally important missions. It does society no good if a miracle medicine is created if it cannot be mass produces and distributed to the public. Chemical engineers have to solve the problem of trying to figure out how to mass-produce the chemicals that were created. There are different elements that have to be considered when mass-producing something. The engineers have to worry about things like heat and fluid forces, which are things that engineers in chemical processing do not necessarily have to worry about since their work is done in a lab and only a small amount of their product is formed (MacDowell). Besides worrying about if it is even possible to mass-produce something, the engineers also have to be concerned with how economical it is to mass-produce it. Once again, it does society no good if it is very expensive to produce something because then no one would be able to afford it. The name of the game is to make the chemicals accessible to society at as low of a cost as possible. </p>
