			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>
	Right from the get-go of The Big Bang Theory bullying is a prevalent issue. In the series premier of the show Sheldon, Howard, Leonard, Raj, and Penny are introduced to the audience. Penny has just moved to Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment complex and has just broken up with her long-term boyfriend, Kurt. Penny wants her television back from her ex-boyfriend, but she feels awkward going back to his apartment and asking for the television back. She decides to ask Leonard and Sheldon to go over to his apartment and get the television back for her. The guys accept the challenge and set about to retrieve the television. When they confront Kurt, he does not want to give the television up and what ends up happening is that he steals Leonard and Sheldon’s pants so they have to drive home in their underwear. The guys return and Penny feels really bad that Kurt stole their pants and makes it up to them by taking them out to lunch (“Pilot”). In this first scenario of bullying, the characters do not do much to stand up to their aggressor or to pursue action against him. They just take the walk-away approach that they have used most of their lives. They just let the bully do what he wants to do and then leave when the bullying is over. This episode showcases the actions that the victim usually takes and that is to do nothing. After this first episode, the show evolves into showing the characters standing up to their aggressors and taking action against them instead of being passive as seen in the series premier.
	Later in season two, Penny’s ex-boyfriend arises again. This episode has Sheldon loaning money to Penny because she loaned much of her spare money to Kurt and she is having trouble making ends meet. Leonard wants to be the hero and help Penny out by trying to get her money back from Kurt. Leonard and Sheldon go over to Kurt’s apartment and they confront him to try to get the money back for Penny. On their first attempt, they are unsuccessful because Kurt does not feel like they should listen to Leonard and Sheldon. The guys go back in defeat like they did in the first episode, but Leonard is not willing to give up. What ensues is that Leonard goes back to confront Kurt to try to get the money back. When Leonard goes back, he is successful in his second attempt because he will not take no for an answer (“The Financial Permeability”). This is a good example of the characters standing up to their aggressor and fighting back and successfully getting what they want. The writers create a situation similar to the series premier and this time they have the characters stand up for themselves so that they may be successful in their task. This situation is showing how even though Leonard gets bullied by Kurt, he is willing to stand up for himself to try to get the money back because he feels that it is important enough for him to keep trying. The scenario shows the audience an acceptable way to stand up to a bully and a non-violent way to solve their bullying issue while building off a previous scenario and giving the audience another way to deal with bullying.
