			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The Big Bang Theory. One of Americaâ€™s great Thursday night pass times. This is a show that is filled to the brim with culture. It brings up serious issues like bullying and puts an exciting and educational spin on it for the audience to learn from and enjoy. The show follows four beautiful mind type scientists: Sheldon, Leonard, Howard, and Raj. These four men are scientists at the California Institute of Technology and embody your typical science nerd. They go to the comic book store multiple times a week, they have comic book collections, they play 3-D chess, and are at times socially awkward. There is a fifth main character that is introduced at the beginning of the series, and her name is Penny. She is the classic farm girl moved to the big city to try to get her big break. The show follows these five people in their normal life. Since most of the main characters are scientists, bullying has been a prevalent issue in their lives. As the show progresses, the audience gets to see bullying situations occur and they get to see how the characters react and be able to learn from that experience, so that they may apply that in their own lives. </p>
